# Product Description Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of product description editing functionality in the backend API.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema (`models/product.js`)
- **Added `description` field** with type String, default empty string
- **Updated `desc` field** to have default empty string
- Both fields are optional and backward compatible

```javascript
desc: {
  type: String,
  required: false,
  default: "",
},
description: {
  type: String,
  required: false,
  default: "",
}
```

### 2. API Endpoints

#### GET `/api/product/get` (Public)
- Returns all products with both `desc` and `description` fields
- `description` field falls back to `desc` if not set
- Both fields default to empty string if missing

#### GET `/api/admin/products` (Admin Protected)
- Returns paginated product list with all fields including descriptions
- Protected by `requireAdmin` middleware (JWT Bearer token required)

#### POST `/api/product/add` (Admin Protected)
- Accepts both `desc` and `description` in request body
- Automatically syncs both fields to keep them consistent
- If only one is provided, the other is set to the same value
- Protected by `requireAdmin` middleware

#### PATCH `/api/admin/products/:id` (Admin Protected)
- Updates product fields including descriptions
- When `description` is updated, `desc` is automatically synced
- When `desc` is updated, `description` is automatically synced
- Protected by `requireAdmin` middleware
- Updates `modified_at` timestamp automatically

### 3. Field Synchronization Logic

The implementation ensures `desc` and `description` fields stay in sync:

**On Product Creation:**
- If `description` is provided but not `desc`: `desc = description`
- If `desc` is provided but not `description`: `description = desc`
- If both provided: both are stored as-is
- If neither provided: both default to empty string

**On Product Update:**
- If `description` is in update body: `desc` is set to same value
- If `desc` is in update body: `description` is set to same value
- This ensures backward compatibility with both field names

### 4. Authentication & Authorization

All admin routes are protected by the `requireAdmin` middleware:
- Verifies JWT token from `Authorization` header (Bearer format)
- Token must be valid and signed with `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET`
- Returns 401 Unauthorized if token is missing or invalid

### 5. Data Migration

A migration script is provided to update existing products:

**File:** `migrations/addDescriptionFields.js`

**Purpose:**
- Sets empty strings for products missing `desc` or `description` fields
- Syncs `description` from `desc` if only `desc` exists
- Ensures all products have both fields with valid values

**How to Run:**
```bash
node migrations/addDescriptionFields.js
```

**When to Run:**
- After deploying the schema changes
- Before using the new description functionality
- Safe to run multiple times (idempotent)

## API Usage Examples

### 1. Create Product with Description
```bash
POST /api/product/add
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Chateau Margaux 2015",
  "price": 599.99,
  "description": "A prestigious Bordeaux wine with complex flavors",
  "category": ["Red Wine"],
  "stock": 50
}
```

### 2. Update Product Description
```bash
PATCH /api/admin/products/507f1f77bcf86cd799439011
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "description": "Updated description with more details about the wine"
}
```

### 3. Get All Products (Public)
```bash
GET /api/product/get

Response:
[
  {
    "ProductId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
    "name": "Chateau Margaux 2015",
    "price": 599.99,
    "desc": "A prestigious Bordeaux wine",
    "description": "A prestigious Bordeaux wine",
    "category": ["Red Wine"],
    ...
  }
]
```

### 4. Get Admin Product List
```bash
GET /api/admin/products?page=1&limit=20&q=Margaux
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>

Response:
{
  "items": [...],
  "total": 150,
  "page": 1,
  "pages": 8
}
```

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation is fully backward compatible:

1. **Existing products** without descriptions will have empty strings
2. **Frontend can use either field name** (`desc` or `description`)
3. **Both fields are always synced** to prevent inconsistencies
4. **Optional fields** - empty descriptions don't break functionality
5. **Migration script** ensures data consistency

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run migration script to update existing products
- [ ] Create a new product with description field
- [ ] Update an existing product's description via PATCH
- [ ] Verify description appears in GET /api/product/get
- [ ] Verify description appears in GET /api/admin/products
- [ ] Test with only `desc` field in request
- [ ] Test with only `description` field in request
- [ ] Test with both fields in request
- [ ] Verify empty descriptions don't cause errors
- [ ] Test admin authentication on protected routes

## Notes

- The `description` field is the primary field for frontend compatibility
- The `desc` field is maintained for backward compatibility
- Both fields are always kept in sync automatically
- Empty strings are used instead of null for consistency
- All admin routes require valid JWT Bearer token
