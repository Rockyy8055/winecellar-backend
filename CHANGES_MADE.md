# Previous Changes: UPS Integration

## Files Created

### 1. `/services/upsTracking.js`
- **Purpose**: UPS tracking service
- **Functions**:
  - `getUPSTrackingInfo()` - Fetch tracking from UPS API
  - `updateOrderFromUPSTracking()` - Update order status from UPS
  - `syncAllActiveOrdersWithUPS()` - Sync all orders
  - `mapUPSStatusToOrderStatus()` - Map UPS codes to our statuses

### 2. `/routes/upsRoutes.js`
- **Purpose**: UPS API endpoints
- **Routes**:
  - `GET /api/ups/track/:trackingNumber` - Get tracking info
  - `POST /api/admin/ups/sync-order/:orderId` - Sync single order
  - `POST /api/admin/ups/sync-all` - Sync all orders
  - `POST /api/ups/webhook` - UPS webhook endpoint

### 3. `/UPS_SETUP.md`
- **Purpose**: Setup instructions for you

## Files Modified

### 1. `/routes/orderRoutes.js`
**Changes:**
- Added `createShipmentForOrder` import
- Added automatic UPS shipment creation after order placement (line 113-122)
- Added admin endpoint to manually create shipments (line 263-276)

**What it does:**
- When customer places order → automatically creates UPS shipment
- Only for delivery orders (not Pick & Pay)
- If UPS fails, order still succeeds (can create manually later)

### 2. `/index.js`
**Changes:**
- Added `upsRoutes` import (line 15)
- Added `app.use(upsRoutes)` (line 46)

**What it does:**
- Registers all UPS routes with Express

## How It All Works Together

```
Customer Places Order
        ↓
orderRoutes.js (POST /api/orders/create)
        ↓
Order saved to DB
        ↓
createShipmentForOrder() called
        ↓
upsShipment.js creates shipment
        ↓
UPS returns tracking number
        ↓
Order updated with tracking number
        ↓
Customer gets email with tracking
```

---

## What's Automatic vs Manual

### Automatic:
✅ UPS shipment created when order placed
✅ Tracking number saved to order
✅ Order status updated to CONFIRMED

### Manual (You Need to Set Up):
⏳ Get UPS API credentials
⏳ Add environment variables
⏳ Deploy to Render
⏳ Configure UPS webhooks (optional)

---

## Testing Locally

1. Add UPS credentials to `.env`
2. Restart server: `node index.js`
3. Place test order via your frontend
4. Check console logs for: `"UPS shipment created for order..."`
5. Check order in database has `carrierTrackingNumber`

---

## No Breaking Changes

- All existing functionality still works
- If UPS credentials missing, orders still get created (just no tracking)
- Pick & Pay orders unaffected
- Existing orders unaffected

---

## Dependencies

All required packages already installed:
- ✅ axios
- ✅ uuid
- ✅ mongoose
- ✅ express

No `npm install` needed!
